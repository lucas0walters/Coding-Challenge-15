## Coding Challenge: Risk Management Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** to track and manage business risks in real time. This project simulates a real-world risk management tool and showcases advanced DOM manipulation and event handling skills. Key features include:

- Dynamic creation and removal of risk cards using `createElement`, `appendChild`, and `removeChild`
- Input form to submit new risk assessments by name, level, and department
- Conditional styling based on risk severity (Low, Medium, High)
- Bulk update functionality to escalate all risks
- Proper use of `stopPropagation()` to handle nested event behaviors

All tasks completed in a modular structure with version-controlled commits per implementation step.
